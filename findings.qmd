## 3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Job Automation Risks: Who Is at Risk?

While AI is **creating new jobs**, it is also **replacing human roles** in certain industries. The **World Economic Forum (2024)** predicts that by 2025, AI will impact **85 million jobs**, but **97 million new jobs** will emerge.

**Top 3 At-Risk Job Categories:**
- **Clerical Work**: Data entry clerks, secretaries, and administrative assistants.
- **Retail & Banking**: Cashiers, bank tellers, and call center agents.
- **Manufacturing & Logistics**: Assembly line workers, truck drivers, and warehouse packers.

‚úÖ **Finding**: The **job displacement risk** is highest for **repetitive, rule-based tasks**‚Äîbut AI-driven reskilling can **mitigate this risk.**

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Rise of New AI-Powered Job Titles

Despite concerns about automation, **entirely new job categories** are emerging in AI-dominated industries.

| **New AI-Driven Roles**        | **Description** |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Prompt Engineers**          | Specialize in fine-tuning AI-generated content. |
| **AI Ethics Officers**        | Ensure AI is used responsibly. |
| **AI-Powered Marketing Analysts** | Leverage AI to optimize digital campaigns. |
| **Automation Engineers**      | Design AI-driven automation for businesses. |

‚úÖ **Finding**: AI is **not just destroying jobs‚Äîit is actively creating new ones** that **never existed before.**

Not all industries are affected by AI at the same rate. Here‚Äôs an **interactive visualization** showing AI-driven job creation vs. displacement.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Industry-wise job impact data
data = {
    "Industry": ["Tech & Data Science", "Finance", "Manufacturing", "Retail & Customer Service", "Healthcare", "Marketing & Advertising"],
    "Jobs Created": [500000, 300000, 250000, 200000, 400000, 150000],
    "Jobs Lost": [50000, 150000, 300000, 500000, 50000, 80000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create interactive bar chart
fig = px.bar(df, x="Industry", y=["Jobs Created", "Jobs Lost"], 
             title="AI‚Äôs Impact on Job Growth vs. Loss by Industry",
             barmode="group", labels={"value": "Number of Jobs", "variable": "Job Impact"})

fig.show()
