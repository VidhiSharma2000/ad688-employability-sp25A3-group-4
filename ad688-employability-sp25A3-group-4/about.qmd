## **Welcome to the Job Market Survival Guide – AI vs. Humans Edition!**

In a world where AI is stealing jobs *and* creating new ones, we (a bunch of stressed-out graduate students) decided to investigate:  

**Is AI actually replacing humans, or is it just another industry hype?**  

### **📌 Why We Did This Project**
Because job hunting in 2024 feels like a game where AI gets all the power-ups while we, the humble human job seekers, are stuck grinding for XP.  

We wanted to analyze:
✅ **AI vs. Non-AI job growth** – Are humans still relevant?  
✅ **Salary trends** – Does AI work pay more, or are robots underpaid?  
✅ **Resume hacks** – Beating AI at its own game (ATS filtering).  

### **👩‍💻 Who We Are**
We're just a team of **data-driven detectives**, using Python, AI models, and analytics to crack the job market code.  

Meet the crew:  
- **Vidhi A. Sharma** – AI optimist (or just hopeful AI won’t take all jobs).  
- **Soham Deshkhaire** – Machine Learning enthusiast trying to outsmart AI.  
- **Nhan (Johnny) Huynh** – The coding wizard making all the magic happen.  

🚀 **Our Goal:** To create a research-driven career strategy **so humans (us) can still land jobs in 2024!**
