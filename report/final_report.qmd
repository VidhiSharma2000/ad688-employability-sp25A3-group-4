## 🧭 Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries—but is it taking all the jobs? In this report, we explore the 2024 U.S. job market to answer three questions:
1. Who’s hiring?
2. What skills matter most?
3. How can we stay competitive in a rapidly changing economy?

We compare AI vs Non-AI roles using a real-world dataset of 100,000+ job postings and leverage big data tools like PySpark, AWS EC2, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Lightcast 2024 U.S. job postings (Jan–Mar)
- **Size**: 100,000+ postings
- **Features**: Job title, skills, salary, description
- **Preprocessing**: Manual AI/Non-AI tagging, TF-IDF vectorization
- **Tools**: PySpark, Jupyter Notebooks, AWS EC2

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

**AI Jobs:**
- Top roles: Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist
- Average salary: ~$118K  
- Common keywords: *"pipeline"*, *"GPU"*, *"TensorFlow"*

**Non-AI Jobs:**
- Top roles: Project Manager, HR Coordinator
- Average salary: ~$72K  
- Common keywords: *"calendar management"*, *"CRM"*

**Insight**: While AI roles offer higher pay, non-AI roles are still in demand and easier to enter.

## 🔎 Skill Gap Analysis

We analyzed missing skills based on job descriptions.

| Track       | Missing Skills                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| AI Track    | Deployment (AWS, APIs), MLOps        |
| Non-AI Track| BI tools (Power BI, Tableau), AI literacy |

**Finding**: Many candidates lack production-level experience in both tracks. Prompt engineering and dashboarding are key upskilling areas.

## 🧠 Modeling the Market

We trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a job is AI or Non-AI based on the text.

- **Accuracy**: 89%
- **Key AI indicators**: *TensorFlow, inference, pipeline*
- **Key Non-AI indicators**: *calendars, CRM, reporting*

---

## 🌐 Hybrid Role Discovery

A growing category: roles that combine business and AI skills.

- Examples: *AI Strategy Lead, Data Product Manager*
- These roles are **high demand + low competition**
- Employers seek cross-functional skillsets (communication + ML)

---

## 💡 Career Recommendations

| Track     | Advice |
|-----------|--------|
| AI        | Focus on real-world projects, deployment pipelines |
| Non-AI    | Master BI tools, use AI tools to automate tasks |
| Hybrid    | Combine soft skills + technical skills, especially in storytelling and analytics |

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Languages**: Python, Spark
- **Environment**: AWS EC2
- **Libraries**: TF-IDF, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Version Control**: GitHub

---

## 🧠 Challenges & Lessons

- Cleaning messy job titles was highly manual
- AWS EC2 setup required patience and restarts
- Merge conflicts taught us version control discipline
- Real takeaway: Data science is 20% modeling, 80% debugging and documentation
