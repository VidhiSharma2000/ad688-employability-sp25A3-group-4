According to the World Economic Forum (2024), AI-driven automation will displace 85 million jobs by 2025 but simultaneously generate 97 million new positions. This shift necessitates a data-driven approach to understand:\n\nHow AI-powered careers compare to traditional job roles.\nWhich industries are experiencing AI-driven job growth vs.¬†job displacement.\nWhat skillsets are most valuable in AI-powered and Non-AI professions.\nHow salary trends vary across AI and traditional careers.\n\nBy leveraging Lightcast data, GitHub collaboration, and Quarto publishing, this research aims to provide actionable career insights for job seekers in 2024."
