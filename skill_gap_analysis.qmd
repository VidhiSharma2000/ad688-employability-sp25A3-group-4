## ðŸ§  Team Skill Self-Assessment

```{python}

## ðŸ“‰ Team vs Market Skill Gap Analysis

```{python}

     "Data Analysis", "Operations", "Information Technology", "SQL (Programming Language)",

]

# Ensure all required skills are present
for skill in top_20_it_skills:
    if skill not in df_skills.columns:
        df_skills[skill] = 0

max_score = 5
skill_gaps = max_score - df_skills[top_20_it_skills]

# Average gap by person
avg_gap_per_person = skill_gaps.mean(axis=1)

# Average gap by skill
avg_gap_per_skill = skill_gaps.mean(axis=0)

# Plotting the average gap per skill
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))

## ðŸ§‘ Individual Skill Gap Summary

```{python}
individual_gaps = 5 - df_skills[top_20_it_skills]

for person in individual_gaps.index:
    print(f"\nðŸ§‘ {person}'s top skill gaps:")
    print(individual_gaps.loc[person].sort_values(ascending=False).head(3))

## ðŸ“‹ Personalized Recommendations

### **Vidhi**
Vidhi should prioritize learning **management**, **operations**, and **problem solving**. These areas are critical for handling project planning, coordinating tasks, and navigating complex challenges in IT environments. To build these skills, Vidhi can take the *IT Project Management* course by Google on Coursera. For operations, LinkedIn Learningâ€™s *Operations Management Foundations* is a great resource. For analytical thinking, the *Creative Problem Solving* course on edX is highly recommended.

To support Vidhiâ€™s development, the team could assign her to lead small projects or retrospectives, which would build both leadership and analytical skills in real time.

### **Soham**
Soham should focus on improving **communication**, **management**, and **leadership**. These are essential for collaboration, confidence, and initiative. Useful resources include *Harvardâ€™s Business Communication*, *Communication for Tech Professionals* on LinkedIn Learning, and the *Leading People and Teams* specialization on Coursera.

Soham can be supported by involving him in meeting facilitation, presenting updates, or leading short planning sessions to grow his comfort with leadership.

### **Nhan**
Nhan should target improving **management**, **communication**, and **leadership**. While technically strong, these soft skills are crucial for senior IT roles. Recommended resources include *Leadership and Emotional Intelligence* on Coursera, *Communication for Tech Professionals* on LinkedIn Learning, and Udemyâ€™s *Practical IT Management*.

The team can help Nhan by encouraging him to present team updates, lead a weekly sprint, or take ownership of communicating project status to stakeholders.
