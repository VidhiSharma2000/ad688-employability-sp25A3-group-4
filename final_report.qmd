## Introduction

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global job market, sparking debates about job displacement, salary disparities, and new career opportunities. As AI-driven automation permeates various industries, professionals must adapt to evolving skill demands. This report explores the **growth and impact of AI vs. Non-AI careers** in 2024, providing insights into **job security, salaries, industry trends, and emerging roles**.

## Research Rationale

AI's influence on employment is twofold: it replaces some jobs while creating new opportunities. According to the **World Economic Forum (2024)**, AI-driven automation will displace **85 million jobs by 2025** but simultaneously generate **97 million new positions**. This shift necessitates a **data-driven approach** to understand:

- How AI-powered careers compare to traditional job roles.
- Which industries are experiencing AI-driven job growth vs. job displacement.
- What skillsets are most valuable in AI-powered and Non-AI professions.
- How salary trends vary across AI and traditional careers.

By leveraging **Lightcast data, GitHub collaboration, and Quarto publishing**, this research aims to provide actionable career insights for job seekers in 2024.
